import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I have more than 15 years of experience in software engineering and development. Currently, I am a Software Engineering Manager at Oracle NetSuite. 

As a manager, I develop and mentor engineers to make sure they are happy, properly motivated, and constantly challenged at work and in life. I lead JAPAC teams to deliver on-time, compliant, and localized tax solutions to NetSuite customers. I constantly collaborate with teams worldwide to add features and improve development experience using Tax Reporting framework. 

Before becoming a manager I was a Software Architect, I designed and built Tax Reporting Framework in NetSuite. This enabled NetSuite teams and Partners worldwide to quickly develop and deploy localized tax reports to NetSuite customers. 

On my spare time, I enjoy journalling and taking notes by hand. I'm a voracious reader, I love the smell of books. I like hifi music. I'm having fun making money trading stocks and crypto. I enjoy the process of tinkering mechanical keyboards. Lastly, I live on coffee so much that I roast and brew my own coffee.
