- Managed a team of 5 developers spread across 3 teams which specializes in developing JAPAC Localization solutions, Tax Reporting Framework, Global Tax Reporting and Withholding Taxes.
- Helped my team identify and utilize their strengths, develop their skills, and ensure that best coding practices are being applied.
- Collaborated with different stakeholders across NetSuite and Oracle to continuously improve and build features for the Tax Reporting Framework.
- Created Tax Reporting Framework CLI an open-source tool to fast forward the creation, development, and deployment of the tax reports in NetSuite.
- Designed and built Tax Reporting Framework from the ground up! This enabled NetSuite teams and Partners to quickly develop and deploy localized tax reports to NetSuite customers. The Tax Reporting Framework has been adopted by different teams worldwide and is the gold standard in building and developing Tax Reports in NetSuite.
- Minimized International team's technical debt by implementing SonarQube ‚Äì a continuous code inspection tool.
